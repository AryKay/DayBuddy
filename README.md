# DayBuddy 0.9 (as demoed in SLUSH 2014)
Your daily assistant and calendar organizer, always ready to service on your wrist! (Application for Samsung Gear S)

# Compatibility
Due to the shortage of support and stability in Samsung's developer tools for the Gear S back in 2014, this was mostly developed on an actual Samsung Gear 2 device and has only been tested on that model. To run, you would need the Gear SDK (more information http://developer.samsung.com/gear/gear-develop-overview ) as well as an official certificate from Samsung. Usually it takes about a day for them to issue one for your device and application project, but afterwards you can simply pull this entire repository on your workstation and install it on your Gear.

Note that this is only the client app for the DayBuddy system. You would still need a host app for your Samsung Galaxy S phone (most recent versions are capable of connecting, fetching, and transferring calendar data to the Gear. I have made a basic client app, which I might upload later after cleaning up the code.
